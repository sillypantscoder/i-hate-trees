# i-hate-trees
Try to cut down as many of people's trees before they come out and see what you're doing.

## instructions

You can install the game by `git clone`ing this repository. Then, you can run the game by running `python3 main.py` or, on Unix, `./main.py`.

Press 'play' to play the game. You can move around with WASD or the arrow keys. You have a chainsaw. You can use your chainsaw by holding down the space key. The chainsaw will destroy nearby trees. A red-and-green bar above the tree will show the tree's health.

If you use your chainsaw too much, it will overheat. Your chainsaw's heat is shown by a red-and-green bar above your player. If your chainsaw overheats, you will have to wait for it to cool down before you can use it again.

You can press Escape to go back to the main menu. In the shop, you can buy various upgrades for your chainsaw.

## mobile version

You can get to the mobile version by going into the settings. In this mode, tapping on the screen will use actions, instead of the keyboard. The screen is divided into a 3x3 grid, and tapping on different cells do different things:

| | Left | Center | Right |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Top | Jump + move left | Jump | Jump + move right |
| Center | Move left | None | Move right |
| Bottom | Use chainsaw + move left | Use chainsaw | Use chainsaw + move right |
