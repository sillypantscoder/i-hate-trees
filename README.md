# i-hate-trees
Try to cut down as many of people's trees as you can before they come and find out what you're doing.

## instructions

You can install the game by `git clone`ing this repository. Then, you can run the game by running `python3 main.py` or, on Unix, `./main.py`. On Mac and Linux, you can run the game by double-clicking the `main.py` file in the file manager (make sure you have Python installed!).

Press 'play' to play the game. You can move around with WASD or the arrow keys. You have a chainsaw. You can use your chainsaw by holding down the space key. The chainsaw will destroy nearby trees. A red-and-green bar above the tree will show the tree's health.

If you use your chainsaw too much, it will overheat. Your chainsaw's heat is shown by a red-and-green bar above your player. If your chainsaw overheats, you will have to wait for it to cool down before you can use it again.

You can press Escape to go back to the main menu. In the shop, you can buy various upgrades for your chainsaw.

When you go past a house, the house will get less transparent, indicating that you have "visited" this house. When this happens, _people_ are liable to come out of the house and see what you're doing. You can tell that people are coming if the window breaks. Only houses with a light-colored window contain a person.
_People_ will follow you around and climb trees. If a person touches you, you die. (Yes, the people are that angry at you.) The people do not ever despawn, but you can kill them with your chainsaw.

Currently, dying has no repercussions.

## mobile version

You can get to the mobile version by going into the settings. In this mode, tapping on the screen will use actions, instead of the keyboard. The screen is divided into a 3x3 grid, and tapping on different cells do different things:

| | Left | Center | Right |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Top | Jump + move left | Jump | Jump + move right |
| Center | Move left | None | Move right |
| Bottom | Use chainsaw + move left | Use chainsaw | Use chainsaw + move right |
